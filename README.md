# 🛒 HM Electronics – Static E-Commerce Website

Welcome to **HM Electronics**, a visually appealing static e-commerce website built using only **HTML and CSS**. It showcases a wide variety of electronic products such as **laptops, smartphones, headphones, and speakers** — organized into clean product sections with stylish cards and hover effects.

This is my **first GitHub project**, created to practice frontend development and improve my web design skills using pure HTML and CSS.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This website is currently **not responsive**, so it is best viewed on a **desktop or laptop screen**.
